    <p>You gotta use dried chickpeas, not the canned stuff. Soak them overnight. This is super important for the right texture. </p>

    <h3>Fresh Herbs:</h3>
    <p>Cilantro (if you're not into cilantro, you can use parsley instead) </p>
    <p>Parsley </p>

    <h3>Onion and Garlic:</h3>
    <p>These give your falafel that classic flavor. </p>

    <h3>Spices:</h3>
    <p>Cumin </p>
    <p>Coriander </p>
    <p>You can also add a pinch of cayenne if you like it spicy. </p>

    <h3>Leavening:</h3>
    <p>Baking soda or baking powder. This helps make the falafel light and fluffy. </p>

    <h3>Flour:</h3>
    <p>Just a little bit to help hold everything together. </p>

    <h3>Oil:</h3>
    <p>For frying. Or you can bake them if you want. </p>

    <h2>Let's Make Falafel: Step by Step</h2>
