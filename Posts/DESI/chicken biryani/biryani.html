    <p>Below is a breakdown of what you’ll need and why each component matters.</p>

    <h3>Chicken and Marinade</h3>
    <p>Chicken: Preferably bone-in pieces for richer flavor.</p>
    <p>Marinade Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>Red chili powder</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tip: Marinate the chicken for at least 2 hours (or overnight) to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</p>

    <h3>Rice</h3>
    <p>Type of Rice:</p>
    <p>Basmati Rice: Known for its long grains, delicate texture, and aromatic properties.</p>
    <p>Restaurant Choice: Many restaurants opt for aged Basmati rice, which provides a more concentrated flavor and improved texture.</p>
    <p>Caring for the Rice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rinse Thoroughly: Wash the rice several times until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Soak: Allow the rice to soak for at least 30 minutes to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Water Ratio: Use a 1:1.5 or 1:2 rice-to-water ratio to prevent the rice from becoming mushy.</li>
        <li>Cooking: Parboil the rice until it is 70-80% cooked, as it will continue to cook during the final layering stage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Spices & Herbs</h3>
    <p>Whole Spices: Saffron, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves.</p>
    <p>Ground Spices: Garam masala, red chili powder.</p>

    <h3>Aroma Boosters:</h3>
    <p>Blooming Spices: Fry whole spices in ghee (clarified butter) to unlock their full fragrance.</p>
    <p>Saffron Milk: Soak saffron in warm milk to enhance both color and aroma.</p>
    <p>Herbs: Fresh mint, cilantro, and sometimes even fenugreek leaves for an extra desi touch.</p>

    <h3>Additional Flavor Enhancers</h3>
    <p>Vegetables: Thinly sliced onions, tomatoes.</p>
    <p>Other Ingredients: Garlic, ginger, and green chilies.</p>
    <p>Desi Touch: A generous spoonful of ghee and a few drops of desi yogurt can add a distinct flavor profile that sets your biryani apart.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Chicken Biryani Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow this detailed guide to create a restaurant-quality chicken biryani at home.</p>
    <p>Each step is designed for clarity and ease, ensuring you achieve the perfect balance of flavors and textures.</p>

    <h3>1. Preparation</h3>
    <p>Marinate the Chicken:</p>
    <p>Combine chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and lemon juice.</p>
    <p>Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight) for maximum flavor infusion.</p>
    <p>Prepare the Rice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rinse the Basmati rice thoroughly until the water is clear.</li>
        <li>Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and the whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon).</li>
        <li>Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70-80% done.</li>
        <li>Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Cooking the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Sauté Onions and Spices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee and add sliced onions.</li>
        <li>Sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add additional whole spices and sauté for a few more minutes until fragrant.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cook the Chicken:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken and cook over medium heat until the chicken is partially cooked and the oil begins to separate.</li>
        <li>Optionally, add chopped tomatoes and green chilies for extra depth of flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Layering the Biryani</h3>
    <p>Layering Technique:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spread a layer of partially cooked chicken evenly over the bottom of a large, heavy pot.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of parboiled rice over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle saffron milk, fried onions, fresh mint, and cilantro over the rice.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers if needed, depending on the amount of chicken and rice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Seal and Dum Cook:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam.</li>
        <li>Cook on low heat (dum cooking) for 20-30 minutes. This slow cooking allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Final Touches</h3>
    <p>Check for Doneness:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gently mix the layers to ensure even distribution of flavors.</li>
        <li>Verify that the chicken is fully cooked and the rice has a tender, fluffy texture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Garnishing:</p>
    <p>Garnish with additional fried onions, fresh herbs, and a squeeze of lemon juice for brightness.</p>
    <p>Serve hot, accompanied by traditional sides.</p>
