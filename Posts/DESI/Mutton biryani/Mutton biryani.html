    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Preparing the Mutton</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Boil water with whole spices and a little salt.</li>
        <li>Cook rice until 70% done and drain excess water.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Cooking the Mutton</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large pot, heat ghee and sauté onions until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Stir in chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>

    <p>Once the mutton is cooked, layer it with the partially cooked rice. Add fried onions, and fresh herbs. Cover and cook on low heat for 20-30 minutes.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve with raita (yogurt sauce) and salad.</li>
        <li>Pair with boiled eggs or kebabs for an authentic experience.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Variations of Mutton Biryani</h3>
    <ul>

     <li><strong>Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani: </strong>Known for its spicy and tangy profile, often using a kachchi (raw) method where marinated raw mutton is layered with rice and cooked together.</li>
     <li><strong>Kolkata Mutton Biryani:</strong>Features the addition of potatoes and boiled eggs, offering a subtle sweetness and distinct aroma.</li>
    <li><strong>Lucknowi (Awadhi) Mutton Biryani:</strong>Characterized by a milder flavor, with meat and rice cooked separately before layering.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

<li><strong>High Cooking Temperatures:</strong>Cooking on high heat can toughen the meat and burn spices.</li>

    <p>Store leftover Mutton Biryani in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Reheat using a pan on low heat or in the microwave.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Tips for Perfect Mutton Biryani</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Quality of Meat:</strong> Choose fresh, high-quality mutton for the best results.</li>
     <li><strong>Patience in Cooking: </strong> Allow sufficient time for the mutton to become tender without rushing the process.</li>
     <li><strong> Rice Handling:</strong> Avoid overcooking rice during parboiling to prevent mushiness in the final dish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Health Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Profile:</strong> Mutton is a rich source of essential nutrients, including protein, iron, vitamin B12, zinc, and potassium. These nutrients play vital roles in muscle development, oxygen transportation, immune function, and maintaining overall health. </li>
        <li><strong>Immunity Boosting:</strong> The spices used in biryani, such as turmeric, cumin, and coriander, possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can enhance the immune system. Turmeric, for instance, contains curcumin, known for its potent health benefits. </li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Incorporating lean cuts of mutton and controlling portion sizes can make biryani a part of a weight-conscious diet. Additionally, the high protein content aids in satiety, potentially reducing overall calorie intake.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong>Spices like ginger and garlic, commonly used in biryani, are known to promote digestion and have antimicrobial properties, contributing to gut health.​</li>
